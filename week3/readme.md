## Week 3: Getting out of the screen: Arduino and basic electronics

1. Check in/recap from last week. (10 mins)
2. A slideshow/discussion of interesting artwork (20 mins)
3. What is Arduino? Plug in the board, open the Ide (15 mins)
4. Working with LEDs: [blink tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink) and [basic circuitry](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/lesson3.html) (45 minutes)
5. Introducing serial communication between Processing and Arduino. Make your light blink with a mouse click (walk through [examples](https://github.com/lizzybrooks/code-based-art/tree/master/week3/examples)). [This tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/connecting-arduino-to-processing#to-arduino) is also useful. (30 minutes)
6. Make your lights react to your Processing sketch from last week (or to a simple mouse-activated drawing). (60 minutes)
7. If you master that, go ahead and add a PIR motion sensor, using Adafruit's PIR tutorial: https://learn.adafruit.com/pir-passive-infrared-proximity-motion-sensor.
