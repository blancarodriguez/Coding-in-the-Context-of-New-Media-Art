##Twitter is a great way to start playing with data visualization. 
Processing.org has a [good tutorial](https://processing.org/tutorials/data/) to explain this stuff in more detail. 
If you feel confident in how this stuff works(or you don't really care about theory and want to just make things happen), then you can use the example code and the tutorials below to start playing.

###Tutorials and Reference Sites for Processing + Twitter
(don't be alarmed if some of these examples don't work right "out of the box". Twitter regularly changes their login processes, so you may need to do some updating/troubleshooting by comparing with our class examples-- still, these have useful information!)
