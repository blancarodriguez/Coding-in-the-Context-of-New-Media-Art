## Twitter is a great way to start playing with data visualization. 

These examples go with the [API tutorial](https://github.com/lizzybrooks/code-based-art/blob/master/week2/tutorials/API_tutorial.md) in this week's syllabus. They do all kinds of different things in Twitter. They're labeled in the comments section at the top of each sketch, but here's a little cheat sheet:<br><br>

Example 1 is a simple example to connect to the Twitter API and test a query.<br>
Example 2 queries Twitter for everything that includes #worldseries. When it finds something that also includes "cubs", it draws an ellipse.<br>
Example 3 queries Twitter every 10 seconds for #worldseries and cubs, and draws corresponding ellipses.<br>
Example 4 searches Twitter for a keyword and prints all the tweets it gets onto the screen.<br>
Example 5 counts the number of #worldseries tweets that contain the word "cubs" and prints that number to the console.<br>
<br>

Processing.org has a [good tutorial](https://processing.org/tutorials/data/) to explain data visualization in more detail. 
If you feel confident in how this stuff works(or you don't really care about theory and want to just make things happen), then you can use the example code and the tutorials below to start playing.<br>

(don't be alarmed if some of these examples don't work right "out of the box". Twitter regularly changes their login processes, so you may need to do some updating/troubleshooting by comparing with our class examples-- still, these have useful information!)
