## Programming concepts explained in human English
This class is mostly about learning by doing/playing with coding puzzles, but sometimes you want to understand a concept or a strategy more thoroughly. This becomes more true when you start wanting to do specific things, rather than just play around and see what happens. This page is a collection of useful tutorials, examples and articles that outline fundamental programming concepts and how to use them in your Processing code. Please suggest new links as you find them! 

#### Big and Basic Concepts

* Daniel Schiffman's heroic video series explains [everything you need to know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCu7JSkgl04&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ajGB2OI3hl5DZsD1Fw1WzR) about object-oriented programming (aka about writing clean, readable code). 
* This doc from Oracle's education module also helps: [Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/index.html) 
* And here's a cool example of why and how you might use a function, from the University of Denver's computer science department: [What is a function?](http://www.cs.du.edu/~malbow/COMP1671/Notes)
* Wikipedia also has some thoughts on Object-Oriented programming: [What is an object?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science))
<br>

#### Working with Variables

* First, what is a variable? How do you put one into your sketch? What can it do? Here's a useful [introduction to the use of variables](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/variables/p/intro-to-variables) from the Khan Academy.
* Is your variable going to scale by whole number jumps or by decimals? Are you being precise or are you making big moves? [Types of variables: Integers vs Floats](https://processing.org/examples/integersfloats.html) (from Processing.org)
* Will you use your variable over and over again throughout the program, or does it do one specific thing once? [Global vs. local variables](https://processing.org/examples/variablescope.html) (from Processing.org)
<br>

#### Loops and Conditionals

* Digital Polymath Jose Sanchez has a great series on introductory concepts in Processing. Let him explain [for loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ebYmgIoWI8)
* and [Conditionals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS_A5miayLk). Then go check out [his website](http://plethora-project.com/). Whoa.
* Wikipedia explores [what is a do while loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_while_loop)?
* Daniel Schiffman explores the difference between a for loop and a [while loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtAPBvz6k0Y). Bonus: you get to see Schiffman troubleshoot his broken code. This happens to everyone! 
* [Try/Catch statements in Processing](https://processing.org/reference/try.html)


* [A brief introduction to debugging: 4 videos, lots of moral support](https://vimeo.com/itpred/videos/search:debugging/sort:date)
<br>

#### Working with Data
* [What is an API?](http://schoolofdata.org/2013/11/18/web-apis-for-non-programmers/)
* [Twitter's Streaming vs Rest APIs](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public)
* Lots of examples for working with Twitter in the examples folder in week 2

* [Arrays](https://processing.org/tutorials/arrays/)
* [Not to be confused with ArrayLists](https://processing.org/reference/ArrayList.html)
