# Coding-in-the-Context-of-New-Media-Art
The class will introduce basic coding and technology skills encouraging students to explore these new skills in their personal work. Topics covered include the importance of coding within the art context and perspectives from artists incorporating arts and technology.Beginning each class we will examine different artists working and using robotics, physical interfaces, interactivity, electronics, data visualization and algorithmic drawing. We will use Processing IDE and Arduino among other technologies. Each class includes time to learn and practice coding and electronics skills with individualized attention. By the end of the class, students are encouraged to create a personal or collaborative project. No previous experience is required! The class main level is for beginners but all skill/experience levels are welcome. All participants should bring a laptop with Processing installed (free software: https://processing.org/). All other materials are included.
Hi There! 


Introduction to Code-Based Art is an open workshop in art and technology that we (Lizzy Brooks and Blanca Estela Rodriguez) are teaching (in physical form) at Root Division, in San Francisco. 

We'll make a series of projects that explore creative and interesting applications of custom technology. 
Each week has its own focus (overviewed below). Look in the folders for more details, examples and source code.

Week 1

TECHNICAL: Introduction to coding in Processing. 
CONCEPTS: What is a digital self portrait?

Week 2:

TECHNICAL: Responsive drawings in Processing. 
CONCEPTS: What is interactivity? How can it show us something about ourselves?

Week 3:

TECHNICAL: Beyond the screen/ introducting to basic circuit building and Arduino. 
CONCEPTS: How to explore/reveal relationships between humans and machines?

Week 4:

TECHNICAL: Exploring motors and sensors. 
CONCEPTS: Now we can do a lot of exciting stuff. How can we use these technologies to illustrate a concept? How can we move beyond the wow factor, and use digital art to ask big questions?
