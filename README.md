# Coding-in-the-Context-of-New-Media-Art

Hi There! 


Coding in the Context of New Media Art is an open workshop in art and technology at CCSF, in San Francisco. 
http://www.ccsf.edu/en/educational-programs/continuing-education/Fall17/Art/listofclasses2/Coding.html

We'll make a series of projects that explore creative and interesting applications of custom technology. 
Each week has its own focus (overviewed below). Look in the folders for more details, examples and source code. 

#### Week 1
TECHNICAL: Introduction to coding in Processing. <br>CONCEPTS: What is a digital self portrait?

#### Week 2:
TECHNICAL: Responsive drawings in Processing.  <br>CONCEPTS: What is interactivity? How can it show us something about ourselves?

#### Week 3: 
TECHNICAL: Beyond the screen/ introducting to basic circuit building and Arduino.  <br>CONCEPTS: How to explore/reveal relationships between humans and machines? 

#### Week 4: 
TECHNICAL: Exploring motors and sensors.  <br>CONCEPTS: Now we can do a lot of exciting stuff. How can we use these technologies to illustrate a concept? How can we move beyond the wow factor, and use digital art to ask big questions?
