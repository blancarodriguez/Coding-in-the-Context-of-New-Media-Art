## Week 4: Motion Sensors and Servo Motors

1. Check in and remember what we did last week. (10 mins)
2. A slideshow/discussion of interesting artwork (20 minutes)
3. Introduce the Servo motor- what can we do with this thing? (10 minutes)
4. Hook up the motor and do Sweep tutorial (40 minutes).
  * Use the [Sweep tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Sweep) to make something with your servo motor.
  * You can also find this code within your Arduino software! Once your wires are connected, go to File-->Examples-->Servo-->Sweep and open the sketch. 
  * Play with adjusting the movement of your motor.  
5. Break/check: everyone cool? (10 minutes)
7. Add a motion sensor! (1 hour)
 * [Here](https://learn.adafruit.com/pir-passive-infrared-proximity-motion-sensor/using-a-pir) is a good tutorial to start working with your PIR motion sensor. 
 * [This](http://www.instructables.com/id/Motion-Activated-Servo/) Instructable is also useful to connect your servo to the motion sensor. Instructables are a great resource for Arduino projects! 
 * The[Adafruit Motor Selection Guide] (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-selection-guide/powering-your-motors?view=all) will help you to understand which motors can do what things.


* Work on a project
