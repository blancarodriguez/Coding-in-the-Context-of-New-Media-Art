## Week 4: Working with an LED matrix panel

1. Check in and remember what we did last week. (10 mins)
2. A slideshow/discussion of interesting artwork (20 minutes)
3. Introduce the LED panel- what can we do with this thing? (10 minutes)
4. Walk through setting up the LED panel and play with the examples (40 minutes).
  * Hook up the panel [tutorial](http://embedded-lab.com/blog/hookup-guide-for-16x32-rgb-led-panel/)
  * Install libraries [tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries)
  * Review the [graphics guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview) to explore what you can do with this library.
  
5. Break/check: everyone cool? (10 minutes)
7. Play with the examples, make your own light drawing (1 hour)
8. Share work, share code (30 minutes)

## Add-ons
* Processing Visualizer for LED matrix panel [here](https://github.com/jdeboi/pimpMyBike)
* Add motion or vibration sensors to activate your display:
For motion, explore PIR sensors with [this overview](https://learn.adafruit.com/pir-passive-infrared-proximity-motion-sensor/overview) and [this example](https://github.com/lizzybrooks/code-based-art/tree/master/week3/examples/arduino).
For vibration sensors, use the Piezo electric disk and the [knock tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Knock).
